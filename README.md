# Your Crib's Climate cost
Climate change is getting worse and it’s starting to affect the places that we live, and where we decide to live is also changing. with the increase of remote work people, especially millennials, are finding they have more freedom to decide where they settle down and buy homes. Investors and pension funds are also buying houses, and everyone is starting to have the same question:

Where should I buy a house so that climate change doesn’t decrease its value in the long term? After all, no one wants to invest in a house that is going to be worthless because of climate change. Right now, a tool for that doesn’t really exist! That's where 'Your Crib's Climate Cost' comes in. 

Your Crib’s Climate Cost predicts the effects of climate change (temperature, precipitation) on future housing prices in a contiguous US zip code

So where did I get my data from? I got historical housing data from redfin, historical temperature and precipitation data from NOAA and forecasted temperature and precipitation data from the NASA NEX DCP30 program. In the future, I plan to include flood and wildfires in that as well.
